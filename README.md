# Control examples

This folder contains control examples for controlling the Vertex using the Avular Programming Interface (API). The examples are written in C++ and use the Avular API to control the Vertex. The examples are built using docker.

The following examples are available:
1. [Circle example](control_examples/circle_example/README.md)

All examples can be built and run in the same way. In all cases, you'll need to build the Docker image first, then start the container and run the example within the container. If you want to automatically start the software in the container, you need to add it to the Docker Compose files.

You can find instructions on how to execute the example in the readme of the example folder.
